## My process

- As this is the start of the project, so the basic measure taken to solve this challenge was implementing the HTML5 elements to make the design as equivalent as the given design files. 
- Implementation of styles.css to make the destop layout as it is via use of CSS positioning as Display property. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- 
### What I learned

The major thing i implemented during this challenge was the CSS display property and implementation of CSS Box model. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

For future the things that can be implemented in this project is that the CSS colour Overlay can be implemented as provided in the challange. Also the CSS position & display property can be properly utilzed and Refractor the code.
